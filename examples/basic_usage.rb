# By using actor.async, you can make calls asynchronously. This immediately
# requests execution of method by sending a message, and we have no idea
# whether or not that request will actually complete because we don't wait
# for a response. Async calls immediately return nil regardless of how long
# the method takes to execute. Therefore, this will print nil.

# In practice, the asynchronous call made above will increment the count before
# we get here. However, do not rely on this behavior! Asynchronous methods are
# inherently uncoordinated. If you need to coordinate asynchronous activities,
# you will need to use futures or FSMs. See the corresponding examples for those.
# Signals can also be used to coordinate asynchronous activities.
#
# The following line could possibly print either 1 or 42, depending on if the
# asynchronous call above completed. In practice, it prints 42 on all Ruby
# implementations because the asynchronous call above will always execute
