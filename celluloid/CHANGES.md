HEAD
----
* Make "Terminating task" log messages debug-level events
* Fix $CELLULOID_TEST warnings

0.16.0 (2014-09-04)
-------------------
* Factor apart Celluloid::Cell (concurrent objects) from Celluloid::Actor
* Introduce Celluloid::ActorSystem as an abstraction around the backend
  actor implementation (idea borrowed from Akka)
* Celluloid::Probe system for monitoring system behavior
* Fix handling of timeouts with Celluloid::EventedMailbox (i.e. Celluloid::IO
  and Celluloid::ZMQ)
* Add timeout support to Celluloid::Condition
* Obtain actor names via Celluloid::Actor.registered_name and
  #registered_name to avoid conflicts with the built-in Ruby
  Class.name method
* Update to timers 4.0.0
* Dynamically resizable pools
* Remove use of core Ruby ThreadGroups
* Simplified CPU core detector
* Better thread names on JRuby for easier debugging
* Thread safety fixes to internal thread pool

0.15.2 (2013-10-06)
-------------------
* require 'celluloid/test' for at_exit-free testing

0.15.1 (2013-09-06)
-------------------
* Only raise on nested tasks if $CELLULOID_DEBUG is set

0.15.0 (2013-09-04)
-------------------
* Remove legacy support for "bang"-method based async invocation
* Generic timeout support with Celluloid#timeout
* Implement recursion detection for #inspect, avoiding infinite loop bugs
* Fix various inheritance anomalies in class attributes (e.g. mailbox_class)
* Avoid letting version.rb define an unusable Celluloid module
* Remove "Shutdown completed cleanly" message that was annoying everyone
* Subclass all Celluloid exceptions from Celluloid::Error
* Log all unhandled messages
* Celluloid::Conditions are now usable ubiquitously, not just inside actors
* Introspection support for number of threads in the Celluloid thread pool
* Use a ThreadGroup to track the threads in the Celluloid thread pool
* Reimplement signal system on top of Conditions

0.14.0 (2013-05-07)
-------------------
* Use a Thread-subclass for Celluloid
  * Implement actor-local variables
  * Add helper methods to the class
* Move IO::Mailbox to EventedMailbox to remove dependency between
  celluloid-io and celluloid-zmq. This makes it easier to maintain
  the evented style of Mailbox.
* Install the `at_exit` handler by default
* Show backtrace for all tasks. Currently only for TaskThread
* Implement mailbox bounds where overflow is logged
* Fix Thread self-join
* Execute blocks on the sender by default
* Fix CPU counter on windows

0.13.0
------
* API change: Require Celluloid with: require 'celluloid/autostart' to
  automatically start support actors and configure at_exit handler which
  automatically terminates all actors.
* API change: use_mailbox has been removed
* API change: finalizers must be declared with "finalizer :my_finalizer"
* Bugfix: receivers don't crash when methods are called incorrectly
* Celluloid::Condition provides ConditionVariable-like signaling
* Shutdown timeout reduced to 10 seconds
* Stack traces across inter-actor calls! Should make Celluloid backtraces
  much easier to understand

* Bugfix: Celluloid::SupervisionGroup#run was broken
* Celluloid::ClassMethods#proxy_class allows configurable proxies
* Improved error messages for Fiber-related problems
* Better object leakage detection when inspecting
* Use #public_send to dispatch Celluloid methods
* #idle_size and #busy_size for Celluloid::PoolManager

0.12.3
------
* Bugfix: Ensure exclusive mode works correctly for per-method case

0.12.2
------
* Disable IncidentReporter by default

0.12.1
------

* New incident report system for providing better debugging reports
* Revert BasicObject proxies for now... they are causing problems
* String inspect that reveals bare object leaks
* Fix bug reporting proper task statuses
* Initial thread dumper support
* Remove Celluloid#alive? as it cannot be called in any manner that will ever
  return anything but true, rendering it useless

0.12.0
------
* Alternative async syntax: actor.async.method in lieu of actor.method!
  Original syntax still available but will be removed in Celluloid 1.0
* Alternative future syntax: actor.future.method in lieu of future(:method)
* All methods in the Celluloid module are now available on its singleton
* The #join and #kill methods are no longer available on the actor proxy.
  Please use Celluloid::Actor.join(actor) and .kill(actor) instead.

* Celluloid::Group constant removed. Please use Celluloid::SupervisionGroup
* #monitor, #unmonitor, and #monitoring? provide unidirectional linking
* Linking is now performed via a SystemEvent
* SystemEvents are no longer exceptions. Boo exceptions as flow control!
* Celluloid::Mailbox#system_event eliminated and replaced with Mailbox#<<

  tasks, allowing different task implementations to be configured on an
  actor-by-actor-basis
* Celluloid::TaskThread provides tasks backed by Threads instead of Fibers
* ActorProxy is now a BasicObject
* A bug prevented Celluloid subclasses from retaining custom mailboxes
  defined by use_mailbox. This is now fixed.
* `exclusive` class method without arguments makes the whole actor exclusive

0.11.1
------
* 'exclusive' class method marks methods as always exclusive and runs them
  outside of a Fiber (useful if you need more stack than Fibers provide)
* Celluloid::PoolManager returns its own class when #class is called, instead
  of proxying to a cell/actor in the pool.

  uses for its own timers

* Celluloid#exclusive runs a high priority block which prevents other methods
  from executing
* Celluloid.exception_handler { |ex| ... } defines a callback for notifying
  exceptions (for use with Airbrake, exception_notifier, etc.)

0.8.0
-----
* Celluloid::Application is now Celluloid::Group
