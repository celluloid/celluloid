Celluloid::ZMQ provides Celluloid actors that can interact with [0MQ sockets][0mq].
Underneath, it's built on the [ffi-rzmq][ffi-rzmq] library. Celluloid::ZMQ was
primarily created for the purpose of writing [DCell][dcell], distributed Celluloid
over 0MQ, so before you go building your own distributed Celluloid systems with
Celluloid::ZMQ, be sure to give DCell a look and decide if it fits your purposes.

[0mq]: http://www.zeromq.org/
[ffi-rzmq]: https://github.com/chuckremes/ffi-rzmq
[dcell]: https://github.com/celluloid/dcell

It provides different `Celluloid::ZMQ::Socket` classes which can be initialized
then sent `bind` or `connect`. Once bound or connected, the socket can
`read` or `send` depending on whether it's readable or writable.

## Supported Platforms

Celluloid::IO requires Ruby 1.9 support on all Ruby VMs. You will also need
the ZeroMQ library installed as it's accessed via FFI.

Supported VMs are Ruby 1.9.3, JRuby 1.6, and Rubinius 2.0.

To use JRuby in 1.9 mode, you'll need to pass the "--1.9" command line option
to the JRuby executable, or set the "JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9" environment variable.

## 0MQ Socket Types

The following 0MQ socket types are supported (see [sockets.rb][socketsrb] for more info)

[socketsrb]: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-zmq/blob/master/lib/celluloid/zmq/sockets.rb

* ReqSocket / RepSocket
* PushSocket / PullSocket
* PubSocket / SubSocket

## Usage

```ruby
require 'celluloid/zmq'

Celluloid::ZMQ.init

class Server
  include Celluloid::ZMQ

  def initialize(address)
    @socket = PullSocket.new

    begin
      @socket.bind(address)
    rescue IOError
      @socket.close
      raise
    end
  end

  def run
    loop { async.handle_message @socket.read }
  end

  def handle_message(message)
    puts "got message: #{message}"
  end
end

class Client
  include Celluloid::ZMQ

  def initialize(address)
    @socket = PushSocket.new

    begin
      @socket.connect(address)
    rescue IOError
      @socket.close
      raise
    end
  end

  def write(message)
    @socket.send(message)

    nil
  end
end

addr = 'tcp://127.0.0.1:3435'

server = Server.new(addr)
client = Client.new(addr)

server.async.run
client.write('hi')

sleep
```
